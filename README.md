#### Subscription based features
1. Add IOT support for Smart Home Integration
     - Users with smart home devices can sync them with EcoBuddy.
     - AI-driven waste monitoring and feedback on recycling habits.
2. Extra Games (3-4): 
     - AR (Augumented Reality) game. This creates interactive challenges where users can recycle "virtual items" in their real environment like the camera scans their surroundings and finds virtual item and asks them to sort it into the correct bins.
3. Personalized Recycling Insight: Complile these data (your recent and past recycling activities) from the users recycling activities in a dashboard. It will include the amount of waste recycled,the environmental benefit achieved and comparison to average recycling behaviors.
     - A user opens their Personal Impact Dashboard in the app after a month of recycling. The dashboard displays the following insights:
         - Recycling Metrics: "You recycled a total of 200 items this month, including 120 plastic bottles, 50 paper items, and 30 aluminum cans."
         - Environmental Impact: "Your recycling efforts have saved 250 kg of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to planting 10 trees!"
         - Progress Tracking: "You set a goal to recycle 300 items this month. You‚Äôre currently at 200 items, with 5 days left to reach your goal!".So they can set recycling goals and the app will help them to achieve It through reminders.This reminders will help them cause the more they recycle the more money and benefit is in it for them 
         - Comparative Insights: "You recycle 15% more than most users in your area.Keep it up!
         - Personalized Recommendations:Consider Recycling More Glass and metals as you have recycled less of these compared to others.
4. Delivery Service for Recyclables that  will come and take the recyclables from their house and straight to the recycling center and priority from kiosks.
5. Recycling Calendars and Reminders: Users can create calendars to properly schedule their activities for a particular date they have chosen for the pickup of their recyclables and the app reminds them probably every 30min ,1hr or 2hrs (depending on the timing set by the user)
6. Making the algorithm of the app to only display news and contents regarding the section of recycling the user is most interested in judging by the users recent activity and their searches using the apps AI (this ai stuff requires payment). This feature may be disabled by a user who will like to get news regarding every section of recycling
7. Virtual Tour of recyling facilities: A 3D model of a recycling facility partner. The user would be able to interact with different sections (sorting,shredding) and learn about each stage of the recycling process and machinery involved. They could also get a recorded video of a recycling facility and watch the behind the scenes that happen at these facilities without physically being there.
8. Personal communication: one on one chatting with each user. only permitted between subscription users.
9. Little to No ads displayed for them depending on their subscription plan.
10. Premium users are able to get scraps from the partners if they are personally interested in it. there'll be a limit on how much they collect. eg 50kg of total goods a month so they dont exploit the feature.

| *Basic* | Free | Casual users (key features, ads, basic challenges, personal with 5 ppl monthly, basic algorithm).|  
| *EcoPro* | 2500 naira/month, 7000/3 months, 14000/6 months, 28000/year | Power users (lesser ads, games, higher algorithm, calendar, personal communication with 25 ppl monthly, dashboard). |  
| *EcoPro+* | 5000 naira/month, 14000/3 months, 28000/6 months, 55000/year | Hardcore eco-warriors (ad-free, all features). |

## Pages/Fixes to do
- Poster still showing annonymous even though im logged in.
- Find a solution to why profile images are saying network error from supabase.

- Firestore.
   - Integerate in Leaderboard for game and waste recycled, 
   - points gotten, 
   - rewards claimed and method of claiming, 
   - profile levels (eco warrior and the likes), 
   - waste history, 
   - phone number/bank account on claim rewards page.
   - Follow and Followers logic, as well as notifications of all sorts. This mean there needs to be a way your profile looks to other people. they shouldnt be able to view personal details (email, phone no, etc) just your name, achievements, followers, post, and points gained.

- Need API's 
   - to handle claim rewards for both data and cash.
   - Waste submission of proper waste allowed.
   - location and dynamic maps. Also more centers for pick-up.

- The model should have better predictions.
- Mobile Kiosk page
- Charity page

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Open your VSCode, Open a folder (create a new on eand name it anything you want sha that maybe Technovation)
2. Once the folder is open, open the terminal, control + `, or just find it in the run (you'll see different sections on top named file, edit, run, help, view, just check I think view or smt till you see terminal, then open it)
3. Now once your terminal is open, everything underneath would be typed into the terminal accordingly. 

### Prerequisites
- Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher) Run this in your terminal 

```bash
node --v
```

- this command should bring out number like this 23.01.0 or smt like that sha. So the first number is the version which should be 23 or 24 since I saw what you downloaded 

2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
```bash
npm --v
```

- same with npm here. It should be around the same as node version number.

4. Expo CLI: After you've confirmed node is properly installed, run this next in your terminal

  ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

5. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- To be sure git is installed, on the left side panel, you'll see a bunch of icons. You're currently in the top one named folder. Check the second/third one the one that says git lens and check if it's connected or if it says install git on windows. if its connected then git bash is installed properly but if it still says install git for windows, it's most likely not properly installed. Although, if you're sure everything installed properly, exit VSCode and open it again. Sometimes VSCode needs to be reloaded.

6. Download Expo Go from android play store.

- After all these above are done and successful, run this in the terminal as well. You can do all of this in the same terminal.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ewa-edun/EcoBuddy.git
```

- then once it successfully cloned, run this:

```bash
   cd EcoBuddy
   ```

- Run this to install node modules, it's a big package but you need it to make sure the app runs smoothly and successfully.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

- After node modules are successfully installed, install these one after the other in the same terminal.

3. **Install Additional Required Packages**
   ```bash
   
   npm install react react-native expo
   npm install lucide-react-native
   npm install @expo/vector-icons
   npm install react-native-svg

   npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
   npm install jest
   npm install @testing-library/react-native
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```


4. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

- Once everything is successfully installed, run this command in your terminal. Once you start this that means the app would start running.

5. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

6. **Running the App**
   
   - **On Physical Device:**
     - Install the Expo Go app from the App Store or Play Store
     - Scan the QR code shown in the terminal with your device's camera.
A QR code will come up in the terminal after you run number 5 command. Scan it and let the app load on your phone.


-By now, you should be able to see the app on your phone with no issues.

7. When you're done checking the app and you want to exit, click control + c to exit the app testing. and if you want to u. it again at a later time start from number 5 again.

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Metro Bundler Issues**
   ```bash
   # Clear Metro bundler cache
   npx expo start -c
   ```

2. **Dependency Issues**
   ```bash
   # Remove node_modules and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```
